# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms problems. It serves as a personal practice collection to strengthen problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures. I will be practicing problems on platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, and documenting my approach, solutions, and thought processes as much as possible.<br>
The goal of this repository is to master Data Structures and Algorithms, continually improving my problem-solving skills and my ability to tackle complex technical challenges efficiently.
