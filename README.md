# Data structures and algorithms

This repository contains solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms problems. It serves as a personal practice collection to strengthen problem-solving skills. Solutions are implemented in Python

## Sorting algorithms

**1 - Selection sort**
A basic algorithm used to sort linear data structures like arrays. Not the best but hey its simple enough to implement

**Intuition:** Assume current index is the smallest element in the array or list. Iterate over the remaining portion of the array to find the smallest element compared to the one at the current index. Swap and repeat until end of the array is reached

Time complexity: O(N^2) for all cases
Space complexity: O(1) - sorts in place
